    <string name="fack">There is an even easier option for creating a custom View which is useful in certain circumstances. If there is a component that is already very similar to what you want, you can simply extend that component and just override the behavior that you want to change. You can do all of the things you would do with a fully customized component, but by starting with a more specialized class in the View hierarchy, you can also get a lot of behavior for free that probably does exactly what you want.</string>
